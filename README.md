Project Title: "List of Ridiculously Specific Phobias People Claim to Have"

Project Overview:
>>This project is a web-based platform that provides users with a humorous and interactive experience. Users can log in and view a personalized list of quirky and oddly specific phobias that people claim to haveâ€”both real and fictional. The platform allows users to explore categories such as "funniest phobias," "animal-related phobias," or "completely absurd phobias," ensuring the content feels dynamic and tailored to their interests.

>>The primary goal of the project is to create an entertaining space that showcases how phobias can be both amusing and relatable while leveraging modern web development practices. Users can also contribute to the platform by submitting their own fictional phobias, voting on the "most absurd" ones, and filtering lists based on preferences.

>>This project is designed to demonstrate all essential technical concepts from the course, including front-end and back-end development, database integration, authentication, deployment, and optional advanced features like caching and scalability.

Key Features:
Personalized Phobia Lists:

Tailored lists based on user preferences (e.g., funniest, most absurd, animal-related, etc.).
Phobia Submission and Voting:

Users can submit their own phobias and vote on their favorites, creating a community-driven content library.
Search and Filter Options:

Allow users to search for specific phobias or filter based on categories.
User Authentication:

Secure user registration and login using Firebase Authentication.
Real-Time Updates:

Utilize MongoDB with real-time capabilities to allow instant updates for phobia submissions and votes.
Mobile-Responsive Design:

A fully responsive and engaging UI built with Tailwind CSS.

Tech Stack:
1)Frontend:
    Framework: React.js with Vite for fast builds and development.
    Styling: Tailwind CSS for sleek, responsive design.
2)Backend:
    Server Framework: Node.js with Express to handle API requests.
    API Development: RESTful APIs to manage phobia data and user interactions.
3)Database:
